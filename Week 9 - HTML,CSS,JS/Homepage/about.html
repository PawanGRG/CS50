        <h2>University Education</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>University of Bristol</strong><br>
            MENG in Engineering Mathematics, 2019 - 2023<br>
            Engineering Mathematics is known for its interdisciplinary nature, blending advanced Mathematics, practical engineering and scientific computing. This approach gives me a broader perspective on problem-solving which allows me to approach software engineering problems from a mathematics and engineering point of view.
Also Engineering Mathematics emphasises solving real-world problems sourced from industrial collaborators or addressing current research challenges and this is evident through the course “Mathematical Data Modelling”. I believe that this experience is valuable in the field of software engineering, where practical, real-world application of skills is key.
Engineering Mathematics emphasises on project-based learning. The course structure includes extensive project work, often in collaboration with external partners or industry. This not only mirrors the project-based nature of software engineering work but also demonstrates my ability to apply academic knowledge in practical scenarios.

        <!-- Additional Courses and Certifications -->
        <h2 id="aboutText" onclick="changeTextColor()">Additional Courses and Certifications</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to my formal university education, I have completed several online courses and certifications to further enhance my skills and knowledge. These include:
            <ul>
                <li>CS50's Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University</li>
                <li>Responsive Web Design Certification by freeCodeCamp</li>
                <li>JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification by freeCodeCamp</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Research and Publications</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>RACfoundation - Performance Study of Fuel Price Predicting Methods (Group Project)</strong> (2022)<br>
            <em>Summary:</em><br>
            RACfoundation exhibited a problem of forecasting fuel prices using external component prices and data. Evaluated and investigated the Regression Model, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network to forecast the Petrol Fuel Pump Price by using the dataset provided by RACfoundation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Toshiba - Storing and Retrieving Robotic Cubes in a Dynamic Environment (Group Project)</strong> (2021)<br>
            <em>Summary:</em><br>
            Toshiba presented a problem of storing and retrieving robotic cubes in a dynamic environment. We structured an optimal strategy to store and retrieve blocks considering maximising storage capacity and minimising retrieval time by treating the problem in 2D and by implementing A* and Dijkstra path searching algorithms.

        <p>
            <strong>Met Office - Comparison of two resolutions of Tropical Cyclones datasets over Bangladesh (Group Project)</strong> (2022)<br>
            <em>Summary</em><br>
            We explored the Tropical Cyclones that hit Bangladesh between 1991-2019 by analysing the dataset, provided by Met Office, which contained 9 ensembles of 12 separate Tropical Cyclones. - Utilised statistical analysis, data visualisation and forecasting via Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network to investigate the differences between the two datasets to justify the additional storage and computational efficiency between the two resolution datasets.
