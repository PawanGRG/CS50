# Week 1 - C
The first week of CS50  introduced the fundamentals of the C programming language, covering concepts such as variables,
data types, conditionals, loops, and functions.  Lectures, assignments, and problem-solving exercises equipped me with 
essential coding skills and a problem-solving mindset.  Week 1 established a strong foundation for my understanding of 
computer science and programming principles, laying the groundwork for subsequent weeks. I completed various assignments
set by CS50 and is displayed above.
