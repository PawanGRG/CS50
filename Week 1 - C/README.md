# Week 1 - C
The first week of CS50  introduced the fundamentals of the C programming language, covering concepts such as variables,
data types, conditionals, loops, and functions.  Lectures, assignments, and problem-solving exercises equipped me with 
essential coding skills and a problem-solving mindset.  Week 1 established a strong foundation for my understanding of 
computer science and programming principles, laying the groundwork for subsequent weeks. I completed various assignments
set by CS50 and is displayed above.
## Cash
In this assignment, I had to implement a programme that prompts the user for the number of cents that a customer is owed and then 
prints the smallest number of coins with which that change can be made. From this assignment, I learnt:
- **User Input Handling**: I gained experience in prompting the user for input and handling it appropriately. In this case, I used `get_int` to retrieve the number of cents from the user and how to ensure that negative inputs are handled by prompting the user again.
- **Mathematical Operations**: I used mathematical operations to determine the number of coins needed. For example, to calculate the number of quarters, I divided cents by 25, and for dimes, I divided by 10.
- **Return Values**: I understood the importance of returning values explicitly from functions using the return statement. Each of the calculate functions is expected to return the number of coins of a specific denomination


## Credit
In this assignment, I had to implement a programme that prompts the user for a credit card number and report whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of eachâ€™s format herein. To determine if the credit card number prompted by the user is valid, an algorithm called the Luhn's algorithm is utilised. From this assignment, the key concepts I learnt: 
- **Algorithms**: I successfully implemented the Luhn's algorithm to verfiy the validitiy of the credit card number inputted from the user
