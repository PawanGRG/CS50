# CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science
CS50 is an introductory computer science course offered by Harvard University, providing a comprehensive foundation in computer science and programming concepts. While pursuing my Master's in Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol, my passion for programming, coding, and problem-solving ignited, leading me to create numerous coding projects. However, I recognised the importance of grasping the fundamental concepts and building blocks of computer science. This realisation fueled my curiosity and eagerness to delve deeper into the subject, ultimately driving me to enroll in CS50. I am presently enrolled in the course and actively documenting my progress, though I have not yet completed it. This repository showcases my progress and the projects I have completed in accordance to the CS50 course.
