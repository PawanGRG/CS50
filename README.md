# CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science
CS50 is an introductory computer science course offered by Harvard University, providing a comprehensive foundation in computer science and programming concepts. While pursuing my Master's in Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol, my passion for programming, coding, and problem-solving ignited, leading me to create numerous coding projects. However, I recognised the importance of grasping the fundamental concepts and building blocks of computer science. This realisation fueled my curiosity and eagerness to delve deeper into the subject, ultimately driving me to enroll in CS50. I am presently enrolled in the course and actively documenting my progress, though I have not yet completed it. This repository showcases my progress and the projects I have completed in accordance to the CS50 course.

## Course Structure
### [Week 1: C](#Week-1-C) 
The first week of CS50  introduced the fundamentals of the C programming language, covering concepts such as variables,
data types, conditionals, loops, and functions.  Lectures, assignments, and problem-solving exercises equipped me with 
essential coding skills and a problem-solving mindset.  Week 1 established a strong foundation for my understanding of 
computer science and programming principles, laying the groundwork for subsequent weeks.
### [Week 2: Arrays](#Week-2-Arrays)
The second week of CS50 introduced the fundamental concepts of arrays, which are essential for storing and manipulating collections of data efficiently. The curriculum emphasised the significance of memory allocation and dynamic resizing of arrays to manage data effectively in computer programs. As the assignments and problem sets became progressively challenging, I had the opportunity to enhance my problem-solving skills further.
### [Week 3: Algorithms](#week-3-algorithms)
Week 3 of CS50 delved deeper into the intricacies of the C programming language, introducing more complex concepts such as algorithms, and memory management. This week focused on how data can be organised and manipulated using arrays. I explored different sorting and searching algorithms, understanding their efficiency and application in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the course shed light on the fundamentals of memory management, including concepts like stack and heap, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation. This week's assignments and exercises were particularly challenging, pushing me to apply these concepts in more complex programming tasks.
