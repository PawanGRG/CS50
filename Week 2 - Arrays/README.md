# Week 2 - Arrays
During this week, CS50 introduced the fundamental concepts of arrays, which are essential for storing and manipulating collections of data efficiently. The curriculum emphasised the significance of memory allocation and dynamic resizing of arrays to manage data effectively in computer programs. As the assignments and problem sets became progressively challenging, I had the opportunity to enhance my problem-solving skills further. I successfully completed a variety of assignments and problem sets, which are showcased above, demonstrating my ability to apply array-related knowledge to real-world programming challenges.
